# ekill

It's like [**xkill**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xkill), but for annoying web pages instead.

Chrome and Firefox plugin for quickly getting rid of elements on a web page.

## Installation

- [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ekill/lcgdpfaiipaelnpepigdafiogebaeedg?hl=en)
- [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ekill/)

![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhardih/ekill/master/example.gif)

## Keyboard shortcut

By default **ekill** is toggled with *ctrl+k*, but this can be modified at will.

Go to [chrome://extensions/shortcuts](chrome://extensions/shortcuts), find the item labeled "ekill" and set it to whatever is most convenient.


## Options

### Grudge (Experimental)

Turning this feature on, will let ekill hold a grudge against offending
elements.

By keeping a record of killed of elements on a per page basis, ekill will try
it's best to remove these elements on subsequent visits to the same page.

A rudimentary ui for toggling *Grudge*, as well as  listing and editing the hit
list, is included in the options page.
